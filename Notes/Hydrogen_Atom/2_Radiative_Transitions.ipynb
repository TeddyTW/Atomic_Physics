    "The solutions we have found to the Schrödinger equation are eigenstates and are constant in time. These states are referred to as stationary states, as they are solutions to the time independent Schrödinger equation, which  results from making the Potential $V(r, t)$ constant in time. These solutions are constant in time, and to make transitions between them, we require a time varying potential - or an interaction. A time varying potential large enough to induce transitions can come from small pertubations from an oscillating electric field (light!) "

    "We do the same with Circularly Polarised light, the angular intergral comes to\n",

    "\n",
    "### Parity\n",
    "To get the $l$ selection rules, we must consider the parity transformation, which transforms the wavefunction to its mirror image $r \\rightarrow -r$, equivalent to the simultaneous transformations $\\theta \\rightarrow \\pi - \\theta$ and $\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi + \\pi$. The hydrogen atom should have the same energy levels after a parity transformation as the Coulomb potential is the same after reflection and electromagnetic forces have $P$ symmetry. The parity operator $\\widehat{P}$ returns the parity $P$ of a wavefunction $\\widehat{P}\\psi= P\\psi$ where $P$ which is 1 or $-1$ for even and odd wavefunctions respectively. By looking at the spherical harmonics of $Y$ it is fairly straightforward to determine that $\\widehat{P}Y_{l,m}= (-1)^lY_{l_m}$.\n",
    "For the probability of transitions to be invariant under parity transformations, respecting $P$ symmetry, $\\mathcal{I}_{ang}$ must also be invariant, i.e\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "For the above statement to be true, either $\\mathcal{I}_{\\text {ang }} = 0$ (forbidden transition) or $l_2 - l_1 = \\Delta l = \\pm 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a bit of intuition we can determine that a singular photon carries $\\pm \\hbar$ or angular momentum, which is transfered to the Atom when it interacts with the electron. Thus, the selection rule can be seen as conserving angular momentum\n",
