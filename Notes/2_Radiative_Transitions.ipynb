    "The solutions we have found to the Schrödinger equation are eigenstates and are constant in time. These states are referred to as stationary states, as they are solutions to the time independent Schrödinger equation, which  results from making the Potential $V(r, t)$ constant in time. These solutions are constant in time, and to make transitions between them, we require a time varying potential - or an interaction. A time varying potential large enough to induce transitions can come from small pertubations from an oscillating electric field (light!) "
