    "What about spontaneous decay? This requires a few steps beyond classical electromagnetism, and actually quantise the field. Lets do this in a sort of hand wavy way, we can formally quantise the photon field at a later point if we want. But for now, lets assume the number of photons in the field can be repsresented by the $n$ of a quantum harmonic osscilator. The perturbation above emit and absorb photons of $\\hbar \\omega$ so this makes sense. The quantum harmonic oscillator has a non-zero ground state, hense the peturbing field is never really zero. We do this by swapping the $N$ to an $N+1$ in the termt aht creates a photon, analogous to the raising operator $A^{\\dagger}$ in the quantum harmonic osscillator. Thus\n",

    "We have taken a step toward quantization of the EM field, at least when we emit or absorb a photon. With this step, we can correctly compute the EM transition rates in atoms. Note that we have postulated that the vacuum has an infinite number of oscillators corresponding to the different possible modes of EM waves. When we quantize these oscillators, the vacuum has a ground state energy density in the EM field (equivalent to half a photon of each type). That vacuum EM field is then responsible for the spontaneous decay of excited states of atoms through the emission of a photon. We have not yet written the quantum equations that the EM field must satisfy, although they are closely related to Maxwell's equations."
