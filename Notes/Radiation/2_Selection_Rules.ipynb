    "The solutions which we have found to the Hydrogen Atomic Schrodinger equation eigenstates which are constant in time and are refered to as staitonary states. An interaction is required to transition between stationary state, which we will conider in the form of an electromagnetic field. This is a semiclassical approach, as a fulk quantum approach would require the quantistaion of the EM field into Photons. Consider the osccilating electromagentic field with polarisation $\\hat{e}_{rad}$.\n",

The interaction hamiltonian of our osicallating electic field is $\\widehat{H}_{I}(t)=e \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{E}(t)$ where $-e\\vec{r}$ is our dipole operator. This is a dipole approximation of the full interation hamiltonian $\\widehat{H}_{I}=\\frac{e}{2 m}(\\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{A}-\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{p})+\\frac{e^{2}}{2 m} \\vec{A}^{2}-e \\phi$, which is valid under the assumption that the wavelength is long compared to the size of the dipole $\\lambda >> a_0$.

Let us consider the vectors $\\vec{r}$ and $\\hat{e}_{r a d}$ First Lets consider the polarisation vector $\\hat{e}_{r a d}$, it can be written in terms of its $z$ component (amplitude $A_\\pi$) and its component in the $xy$-plane, written as a superposition of two circular polarisations (amplitudes $A_{\\sigma^+}$, $A_{\\sigma^-}$)\n",

    "## Selection Rules\n",
    "This all seems a bit abritary, but there is some insight coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Polarisation\n",
    "Consider the component of the electric field parallel to the z-axis $A_z$, which will induce a dipole moment on the atom proportional to $\\hat{e}_{rad} \\cdot \\hat{e}_z = \\cos{\\theta}$ making the integral over the angular parts of the wavefunction\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{ang}}^{\\pi}=\\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} Y_{l_{2}, m_{2}}^{*}(\\theta, \\phi) \\cos \\theta Y_{l_{1}, m_{1}}(\\theta, \\phi) \\sin \\theta \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\mathrm{d} \\phi  \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The probability of transition should be unchanged by any cylindrical rotation of the system, and thus $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{ang}}^{\\pi}$ is expected to demonstrate cylindrical symmetry, therefore $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{ang}}^{\\pi}=\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\\right) \\phi_{0}} \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{ang}}^{\\pi}$, thus leading to the selection $\\Delta m_l = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular Polarisation\n",
    "We do the same with Circularly Polarised light, the angular intergral comes to\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "I_{a n g} \\sim \\iint_{0}^{2 \\pi \\pi}\\left(Y_{l_{j}}^{m_{l_{j}}}\\right)^{*} \\sin \\theta e^{\\pm i \\phi} Y_{l_{i}}^{m_{l_{i}}} \\sin \\theta d \\theta d \\phi\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we consider the of symmetry with respect to rotation about the zaxis through an arbitrary angle.  $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{ang}}^{\\pi}=\\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\left(m_{1}-m_{2} \\pm 1 \\right) \\phi_{0}} \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathrm{ang}}^{\\pi}$ which (using the same logic as previously) states that either $I_{ang}=0$ or that  $\\Delta m_l = \\pm 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parity\n",
    "To get the $l$ selection rules, we must consider the parity transformation, which transforms the wavefunction to its mirror image $r \\rightarrow -r$, equivalent to the simultaneous transformations $\\theta \\rightarrow \\pi - \\theta$ and $\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi + \\pi$. The hydrogen atom should have the same energy levels after a parity transformation as the Coulomb potential is the same after reflection and electromagnetic forces have $P$ symmetry. The parity operator $\\widehat{P}$ returns the parity $P$ of a wavefunction $\\widehat{P}\\psi= P\\psi$ where $P$ which is 1 or $-1$ for even and odd wavefunctions respectively. By looking at the spherical harmonics of $Y$ it is fairly straightforward to determine that $\\widehat{P}Y_{l,m}= (-1)^lY_{l_m}$.\n",
    "For the probability of transitions to be invariant under parity transformations, respecting $P$ symmetry, $\\mathcal{I}_{ang}$ must also be invariant, i.e\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\widehat{P}\\mathcal{I}_{\\text {ang }}=(-1)^{l_1 + l_2 + 1}\\mathcal{I}_{\\text {ang }} = \\mathcal{I}_{\\text {ang }}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "For the above statement to be true, either $\\mathcal{I}_{\\text {ang }} = 0$ (forbidden transition) or $l_2 - l_1 = \\Delta l = \\pm 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a bit of intuition we can determine that a singular photon carries $\\pm \\hbar$ or angular momentum, which is transfered to the Atom when it interacts with the electron. Thus, the selection rule can be seen as conserving angular momentum\n",
