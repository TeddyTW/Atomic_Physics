    "## Radiative Transitions\n",

    "The solutions which we have found to the Hydrogen Stomic Schrodinger equation eigenstates which are constant in time and are refered to as staitonary states. An interaction is required to transition between stationary state, which we will conider in the form of an electromagnetic field. This is a semiclassical approach, as a fulk quantum approach would require the quantistaion of the EM field into Photons. Consider the osccilating electromagentic field with polarisation $\\hat{e}_{rad}$.\n",

The interaction hamiltonian of our osicallating electic field is $\\widehat{H}_{I}(t)=e \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{E}(t)$ where $-e\\vec{r}$ is our dipole operator. This is a dipole approximation of the full interation hamiltonian $\\widehat{H}_{I}=\\frac{e}{2 m}(\\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{A}-\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{p})+\\frac{e^{2}}{2 m} \\vec{A}^{2}-e \\phi$, which is valid under the assumption that the wavelength is long compared to the size of the dipole $\\lambda >> a_0$.
